<h2 style="font-size: 24px;"> Housing by State Interactive Dashboard </h2>


**The Topic**

We are going to build an interactive dashboard showing home prices compared to the national average, home price appreciation compared to population growth, and affordability by county map by state. This will include a dropdown on the interactive dashboard to select a state. We are doing this to highlight housing trends in the US.

**The Datasets**

State home values by year: https://www.zillow.com/research/data/ 

Census Data: https://www.census.gov/data/tables/time-series/dec/popchange-data-text.html

National home value data: https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/MSPUS

**The Inspiration**

**The Visualizations**
<ul>
<li>Visualization 1: Line graph showing state and national home value over time (monthly, potential time series)</li>

<li>Visualization 2: Scatter plot all states percent value change (y) and percent population change (x). All states will be visible on the scatterplot, with the selected state being highlighted. (2010-2020)</li>

<li>Visualization 3: Map of USA with states, gradient based on affordability (defined as income v home value). Selected state gets highlighted.</li>
</ul>
